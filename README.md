Hey there ðŸ‘‹! I am Mohan. Python developer who loves creating efficient solutions. I'm all about Python, and I am working with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, and SQL databases. Then, I started my career in a product based company - Anunta Technology as a software developer. Here I gained knowledge about virtual and cloud computing platforms in Microsoft Azure.
My main area of technical expertise are in Python, Django, FastAPI, and Postgres SQL.

Tech has been a wild ride of continuous learning for me, and I'm always up for fresh challenges and collaborations.
